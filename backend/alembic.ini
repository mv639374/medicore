# Configuration file for Alembic, the database migration tool.
# What: It tells Alembic where to find its migration scripts and what database to connect to.
# Why: Alembic allows us to manage changes to our database schema over time in a structured, version-controlled way. This is far more reliable than manually editing the database.
