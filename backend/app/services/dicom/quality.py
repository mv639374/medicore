# What & Why: This service analyzes the quality of the DICOM image itself. It will check for issues like blurriness (sharpness), poor contrast, or excessive noise. This is a placeholder for now, but it establishes the structure for adding real image quality checks later, which are vital for ensuring reliable AI analysis.
