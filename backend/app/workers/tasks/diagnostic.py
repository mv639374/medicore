# What: This is our first background task. The @celery_app.task decorator tells Celery that this function can be executed by a worker. It contains the placeholder logic for processing a DICOM file.

# Why: This is where the heavy lifting happens. By putting this logic in a Celery task, our API can respond to the user instantly while this function runs in the background, providing a much better user experience.
