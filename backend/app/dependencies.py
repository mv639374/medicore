# What: This file will hold our dependency injection functions. These are special functions that FastAPI can run before processing a request. For now, we are creating placeholders for getting the current user and checking their permissions.
# Why: Dependencies help us write reusable logic (like authentication checks) and keep our endpoint code clean and focused. Instead of writing user-checking code in every endpoint, we can just "depend" on get_current_user.
