# This file will import all our database models.

# What: It imports the model classes we are about to create.

# Why: This makes it easy for other parts of our application (like Alembic) to find and use our models just by importing from this package.

# We will come back to this file later to import our models.
# This makes them easily accessible for Alembic autodiscovery.

# from .patient import Patient
# from .user import User
